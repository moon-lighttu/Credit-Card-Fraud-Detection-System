## 🧠 Overview

Swipe Shield is a machine learning-powered credit card fraud detection system built using a highly imbalanced dataset (only 0.17% fraud cases). The system is capable of identifying fraudulent transactions based on anonymized features using multiple classification models.

A user-friendly **Streamlit web application** allows users to simulate transaction inputs and receive real-time fraud predictions.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ⚡ **Accurate Fraud Detection** on an imbalanced dataset  
- 🌐 **Live Web Application** powered by Streamlit  
- 💾 **Model Serialization** with `cloudpickle` for production-grade deployment  
- 📈 **Interactive Inputs** to simulate real-time credit card transactions  
- ☁️ **Google Drive Integration** for dynamic model loading  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, Streamlit  
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy, cloudpickle  
- **Deployment**: Streamlit Cloud, Google Drive

## 📥 Installation

To run the app locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chiragmiyy/Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System.git
cd Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-System

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

Once the app is running, you'll be prompted to enter transaction details such as:

- **Time**  
- **Amount**  
- **V1 to V28** (anonymized PCA components)

After submitting the input, the model returns a prediction:

- ⚠️ **Fraud Detected!**  
- ✅ **Transaction is Safe!**

> The model is dynamically loaded from a cloudpickle file hosted via Google Drive.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)  
- Contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013  
- Features are anonymized (`V1` to `V28`) using PCA
